Elements still not 100% clear - differences between the car - currently it's the throttle, turning speeds and other factors but I see that they may be minute details that should be clarified explicitly.
Another feature yet to be fully completed is it Should be 3 laps - I switched it to 1 to check for bugs will switch it back to 3 and reupload. 
To start the game open it in unity and double click main menu.

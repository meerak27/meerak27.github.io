#  Car Racing Game

## Overview
The game includes three different tracks: one based on a mountain terrain, one in a forest, and one in a city. Each track features a shortcut that players can take during the race. Players can choose from three different cars: red (slowest), blue (slightly faster), and black (fastest). The game includes AI opponents using Unity NavMesh Agent, visible car damage on collision, and replay functionality with saved video files.
## Initial Comments
Elements still not 100% clear - differences between the car - currently it's the throttle, turning speeds and other factors but I see that they may be minute details that should be clarified explicitly.
Another feature yet to be fully completed is it Should be 3 laps - I switched it to 1 to check for bugs will switch it back to 3 and reupload. 
To start the game open it in unity and double click main menu.
## Changes made
The differences between the cars are more evident.
The laps is reverted back to 3.
## Points Completed
All of the points were successfully completed and can be viewed both in the demo and game uploaded.
## Bonus Points completed
Both 1 and 2 were sucessfully impelmented as can be seen in the video. The bottom right corner had the replay and the car becomes dirtier as it crashes into other vehicles and surroundings.
## Controls
Steering: Use the WASD keys to steer the car.
Acceleration: Use the W key to accelerate.
Braking/Reverse: Use the S key to brake or go in reverse.
Choosing Car: Players can choose from the red, blue, or black car at the beginning of the race.
Choosing Track: Players can choose one of the three tracks to race on.

## Game Mechanics

Please view the files here if there are any issues as I am having many issues with my github. Again, .rar was the only way it is allowing me to upload.
